=======================================================================

This is the PhD Thesis of Nabil Freij at the University of Sheffield.

Information
---------------

This is based on the thesis template [here](https://github.com/kks32/phd-thesis-template).

### Obtaining the data

That will be impossible.

### Building the Thesis

As it stands, as the figures do not need the raw data to be made. This will build with pdflatex and output a file at `thesis/thesis.pdf`.
