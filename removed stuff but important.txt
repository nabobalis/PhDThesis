\subsection{Measuring the horizontal phase speed}

	In order to measure the horizontal phase speed of the observed waves, the data extracted from the slits placed around the pore is analysed with a canny filter algorithm that is designed to detect edges in images.
	Once the edges of the wavefronts are identified, the regions of interest are then computed through a Progressive Probabilistic Hough Transform\citep{Galamhos1999}.
	This method is an expansion of the original Hough Transform which is used to detect straight lines in images\citep{duda1998}.
	A method designed to explore the available parameter space for straight lines and returns the beginning and end of any line segment.
	Once the line segments are returned, the gradient can be calculated and followed by a quick conversion into units of km s$^{-1}$.
	This enables us to accurately calculate the speed of the wave front throughout all of the available slits, and to see how the speed changes with time.
	These algorithms, as well as the contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm, are provided by the Python image processing package, Scikit-Image (see http://scikit-image.org/).

	The MHD wave theory applicable for the observed waves in magnetic pores is an application of the theory derived by, e.g., \citet{1982SoPh...75....3S,1983SoPh...88..179E}.
	Previous applications of the theory	have employed the thin tube approximation to study wave propagation.
	However, as we will demonstrate later, this is not valid for the waves we observe and we examine the finite tube equations here.
	We	note that, for reasons of clarity, in the following discussion the theory does not take into account gravitational effects on wave propagation.
	However, the influence of gravity maybe important for wave propagation in magnetic pores, especially at the photospheric level where the predicted scale height is comparable to the wavelengths of observed oscillations.

	The MHD modes allowed to propagate in an intense flux tube in the photosphere fall into three distinct bands, namely fast surface modes, slow body modes and slow surface modes.
	The phase speed for modes in both the slow bands, in the long wavelength limit (i.e thin-flux tube), is the tube speed, defined as
	\begin{equation}
		c_T=\frac{c_sv_A}{(c_s^2+v_A^2)^{1/2}},
		\label{eq:tube}
	\end{equation}
	where $c_s$ is the sound speed and $v_A$ is the Alfv\'{e}n speed.
	For typical conditions in magnetic pores the magnitude of the speeds are $c_T<c_s<v_A$.

%	Over the past decades, many oscillatory phenomena have been observed within a wide range of magnetic waveguides in the solar atmosphere \citep{banerjee,wang2011standing,2012ApJ745L18A,2012LRSP92A}.
%	Sunspots and pores are just two of these many structures, and they are known to display solar \textit{global} oscillations.
%	See a recent review by, e.g., \cite{pinter2011effects}.
%	The commonly studied oscillatory periods in sunspots are three and five minutes.
%	These oscillations are seen in intensity, line-of-sight (LOS) velocity, and LOS magnetic field.
%	The source of the five-minute oscillation is a result of forcing by the five-minute (\textit{p}-mode) global solar oscillation \citep{marsh2008p}, which forms the basis of helioseismology \citep{thompson2006magnetohelioseismology,pinter2011effects}.
%	The five-minute oscillations are typically seen in simple molecular and non-ionized metal lines, which form low in the umbral photosphere and are moderately suppressed not only in the penumbra, but also in the chromospheric atmosphere above the umbra \citep{OASO}.
%	The cause of the three-minute oscillations is still unknown, but there are two main streams of theories.
%	They could either be standing acoustic waves that are linked to the resonant modes of the sunspot cavity, or they could be low-$\beta$ slow magneto-acoustic-gravity waves guided along the ambient magnetic field \citep{OASO}.
%	The three-minute oscillations are seen in plasma elements that form higher up and in the low chromosphere, and these are also moderately suppressed in the penumbra \citep{ORWS}.
%
%	When applied to a cylindrical magnetic flux tube, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory reveals that a variety of waves can be supported, four of which are often reported in various structures in the solar atmosphere.
%	Slow sausage (longitudinal) \citep{2009SSRv..149...65D,wang2011standing}, fast kink \citep{2009A&A...497..265A,2009SSRv..149....3A}, fast sausage \citep{mcateer2003observational}, and Alfv\'en (torsional) waves \citep{jess}, each affects the flux tube in a specific way.
%	The sausage modes are of interest here, because the sausage mode is a compressible, symmetric perturbation around the axis of a flux tube that causes density perturbations that can be identified in intensity images \citep{fujimura}.
%	Furthermore, because the wave will either compress or expand the flux tube, the magnetic field will also show signs of oscillations.
%	This mode may come in two forms in terms of phase speed classification: a slow mode (often also called the longitudinal mode), which generally has a phase speed close to the characteristic tube speed; and fast mode, which has a phase speed close to the external sound speed, assuming a region that has a plasma-$\beta > 1$ \citep{2003ASSL..294.....G,rbook}.
%	A main difference between the two modes is the phase relationship between appropriate MHD quantities, which allows them to be identified.
%	In this case, the fast sausage mode has an out-of-phase relationship between the area and intensity, while the slow sausage mode has an in-phase relationship.
%	The technique that was applied to obtaining these phase relationships are covered by, say \cite{goedbloed}, \cite{fujimura}, \cite{moreels2013phase}, and \cite{michal2013}.
%
%	Sausage modes have been observed in solar pores.
%	\citet{doretala} observed a pore for 11 hours and reported periodicities in the range of 20-70 minutes.
%	These oscillations were consequently interpreted as linear low-frequency slow sausage waves. \citet{morton} used the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) instrument to also identify linear sausage oscillations in a magnetic pore.
%	However, determining whether the oscillations were slow or fast proved to be difficult.
%	\citet{2012NatCo...3E1315M}, found the presence of fast sausage and kink waves higher in the solar atmosphere with enough wave energy to heat the chromosphere and corona.
%
%	The source and driving mechanism(s) of these MHD sausage modes have been very difficult to identify.
%	Numerical simulations of a flux tube rooted in the photosphere, which is buffeted by a wide range of coherent sub-photospheric drivers, is one method for identifying the potential source of MHD sausage waves.
%	These drivers can either be horizontal or vertical, single, or paired or else a power spectrum, with varying phase differences \citep[see e.g.][]{malins,khomenko,fedun2,fedun1,vigeesh2012three}.
%	One example of a horizontal driver is the absorption of the global solar \textit{p}-mode oscillation by a sunspot \citep{1992ApJ...384..348G}.
%	More recently, \citet{mathew} has also studied this absorption and found a structured ring-like absorption pattern in Doppler power close to the umbral-penumbral boundary.
%	This effect was strongest where the transverse magnetic field was at its greatest, and this region allows fast waves to be converted into slow magneto-acoustic waves, which are a potential source of MHD waves in sunspots and other similar magnetic structures.
